# Summary:
This script is not hardcoded to this region or specified counties.  That means that we can use this code to change a variety of parameters.  We can add more candidates whenever you are ready to move into a larger political race.  We can even change variables to determine what platforms resulted were your biggest success and which ones we need to improve.
